      <p>My name is Skylar Garrison and I am a budding software developer from the birthplace of Rock and Roll - Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
      <p> Growing up, I wanted to be many things, but my top two choices were to be a teacher or an engineer. What type of teacher or engineer I wanted to be changed with my experiences, but I had three core wants for my career.</p> 
      <!-- ordered list, will be numbered automatically; from least to most important career needs to me -->
      <ol>
      <li>The ability to learn and face new challenges every day</li>
      <li>To be able to work and interact with others</li>
      <li>To make people happy!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Please feel free to take a look around and visit the links in my <a href="#contactme">Contact Me</a> section if you'd like to know more about me.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Web development wasn't my first choice for a career path. I have so many things I wanted to pursue; accounting, computer engineering, criminal justice, psychology! The list never ends.</p>

      <p> While I still enjoy learning about all of the afforementioned things, I am ready to jump right in to life as a web developer. I get to learn new things every day, help and teach others and, best of all, make a lot of people happy.</p>
